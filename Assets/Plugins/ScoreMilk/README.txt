Hello and Welcome to the ScoreMilk platform!

=========== Quick Start ===========

1) Select "WebGL" as game Platform.
    - Go to: File > Build Settings > Platform
    - Select "WebGL"
Note: If you donâ€™t find this option or it is disabled, please install WebGL build support package in Unity Hub.

2) Set WebGL Template to ScoreMilkTemplate
    - Go to: Edit > Project Settings > Player > WebGL > Resolution and Presentation
    - Select "ScoreMilkTemplate"

3) Check "Run in Background" option
    - Go to: Edit > Project Settings > Player > WebGL > Resolution and Presentation, if you aren't already
    - Check in "Run in Background"

4) Drag ScoreMilkManager Prefab to first scene
    - Go to folder: Assets/Plugins/ScoreMilk/Prefabs
    - Select and Drag "ScoreMilkManager" prefab to scene
    - Prefab can be in every scene, it is an singleton that automatically removed copies

5) Subscribe GameObjects to ScoreMilk Events
    - You Subscribe events in a GameObject like this:
        private void OnEnable() {
            ScoreMilk.Connection.OnReceivedMatchmakingStart += OnMatchmaking;
        }
        private void OnDisable() {
            ScoreMilk.Connection.OnReceivedMatchmakingStart -= OnMatchmaking;
        }
    - You have to Subscribe/Unsubscribe to 4 events:
        ScoreMilk.Connection.OnReceivedMatchmakingStart: Player pressed "play" button. Game should go to real match scene and wait for start.
        ScoreMilk.Connection.OnReceivedToPractice: Player pressed "practice" button. Game should go to a practice scene. NOT title screen.
        ScoreMilk.Connection.OnReceivedCancelMatch: Match was cancelled for any reason. Game should go back previous scene or title.
        ScoreMilk.Connection.OnReceivedStart: Both players are ready and accepted the required crypto transaction. Game should continue and start match.
        ScoreMilk.Connection.OnReceivedWalletConnected:  Wallet connected
        ScoreMilk.Connection.OnReceivedWalletDisconnected:  Wallet disconnected

    - Sends wallet id in event
    Notes:
    - Unsubscribing is not strictly necessary, but it's considered good practice.


6) Emit messages to server accordingly to game
    - You Emit messages like this:
        ScoreMilk.Connection.EmitAddScore(points);

    - You have to Emit 3 messages:
        ScoreMilk.Connection.EmitReady(): When online Scene is fully loaded
        ScoreMilk.Connection.EmitAddScore(int points): When player scored <points> points
        ScoreMilk.Connection.EmitGameOver(int points): When game has ended. 

    Notes:
    - Location of code varies heavily accordingly with game
    - Points can be positive or negative. Negative points decrease final value.
    - Points emitted at GameOver must be the same as the sum of all points emitted previously.


7) You are done! 
    - Build the game and send us the built files!
